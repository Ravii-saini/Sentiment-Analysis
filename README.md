# IMDB Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis model designed for classifying IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model provides a quick sentiment assessment, highlighting trends in audience reactions to movies.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an NLP pipeline to preprocess and clean text data from IMDB reviews.
- Extract meaningful features from the text data using vectorization techniques.
- Train and evaluate a sentiment classifier to distinguish between positive and negative reviews with high accuracy.

## Key Steps

### Data Collection
- Utilized the IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning**: Removed stop words, punctuation, and applied lowercasing.
- **Tokenization and Stemming**: Broke down sentences into words, applied stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
- **Feature Vectorization**: Converted cleaned text into numerical data using methods like bag-of-words and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

### Feature Extraction
- Used n-grams and word embeddings to capture context within the text.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and LinearSVC.
- Evaluated model performance based on accuracy and F1-score, achieving an accuracy of over 90%.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Spyder IDE
- **Libraries**: 
  - **NLP**: NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow

## Results
- **Model Performance**: Achieved 90%+ accuracy on test data, demonstrating reliable classification of movie reviews.
- **Data Processing Techniques**: Employed techniques like TF-IDF, stop word removal, and n-grams to boost model performance.

## Sample Code Snippet

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Vectorizing reviews using TF-IDF
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(reviews)

# Training a Logistic Regression Model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
